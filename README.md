# Sample Flows

This repository contains Prefect's sample Flows. We use them for a few reasons (demos, internal use cases, fun). Please feel free to use anything in here for your own project!

Happy Engineering :)

For the Twitter API Flow:

Create a .env file with the following credentials:
```
TWITTER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE
```
